# APP-assignment
Full stack website that displays a band tour dates using Flask with HTTP requests for the server side.

This project was created in Replit for the unit assignment. Flask is serving the main page and handling HTTP requests and deals with routes. Javascript handles the front-end and sends the form values to the Flask API.

The Repl is available at https://replit.com/@s5520688/APP-assignment

To run the Repl go to main.py and click on Run.
